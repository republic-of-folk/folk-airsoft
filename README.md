Republic of Folk Airsoft
===============================================================================

We present you the newest novelty toy from the remote island republic that normally you'd associate with ~~cheap~~ reasonably priced electronics - airsoft gun replicas! Aimed at adults and children at all ages*, aifsoft gun replicas provide realistic military fun compared to no other toy.

Republic of Folk Airsoft replicas provide:

* A collection of realistic looking gun replicas
* Both realistic and high capacity magazines
* A pack of safe to play 6mm plastic pellets 

_* Safety hazard: __never__ aim your airsoft replica at other people nor animals!_


## Installation

If you're not using Steam Workshop version, simply download the latest version and unpack it in your Arma 3 installation folder. Then launch Arma 3 with `-mod=@folk_airsoft` parameter.


## Safety hazard

Republic of Folk Airsoft comes with standard plastic pellets and lethal ammunition. Both have same ballistic properties (or lack those) but standard version causes no damage at all and needs to be scripted in the mission.


## Shameless plug

We might not use airsoft replicas of a daily basis, but if you're lucky we'll let you drive a BMP. They you'll pay for the damages you'll cause.


## Building your own replica

This addon provides two types of ammunition: `rof_B_6mm_020g_bb` and `rof_B_6mm_020g_lethal`.

When working on your mod, add requirement for `rof_weapons_airsoft_core` and create magazines that use one of these ammo classes and has attribute `initSpeed = 107;` (which gives you 350fps muzzle velocity), and `tracersEvery = 1;` (so pellets are visible in flight).
